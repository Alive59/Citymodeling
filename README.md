# Citymodeling
This is a course of shenzhen university for 2018 GIE students. 
City modeling and simulation is the science of getting computers to modeling the city. In the past decade, city modeling and simulation are mainly conducted by manually, and widely used for gaming or city visulization. It is time-consuming and costly. In the recently years, computer vision, deep learing and machine learning techniques have developed rapidly which increase the automatic degree of 3D reconstruction, semantic recognition and segmentation. In this class, you will learn about the more effective 3D modeling techniques, and gain partice implementng them and getting them to work for yourself. More improtantly, you'll learn about not only the theoritical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to queckly and powerfully apply these algorithms for 3D applications. Finally, you'll need to use a new simulation framework 'cesium' for the integration of your data.
